## Jupyter Notebook 

We have created a jupyter notebook called calssifier.ipynb to display our work.  
This notebook contains two main sections:
  - Part 1: Data Processing and Representation
      - 1.1 Representing data as a time series
      - 1.2 Representing data as images (spectrograms)
      - 1.3 Display MFCC Features
        - To display the MFCC features uncomment and run _displayMFCC("train",duration_to_read)
      - 1.4 Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA
        - To display the MFCC PCA uncomment and run _displayMFCCPCA("train", duration_to_read)
  - Part 2: Classification
      - 2.1 SVM
      - 2.2 Neural Network
      - 2.3 Logistic Regression
